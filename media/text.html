    <p>
    How come I shiver, hurt and bleed,<br>
    If in dreams I cannot truly feel<br>
    Who would dare say, who would claim<br>
    This hallucination isn't real<br>
    Synaptical glitch looking glass<br>
    So enticing, real and free of lies<br>
    Prodigious, omnifarious<br>
    In nourishes, it feeds my starving eyes<br>
    Artificial the catalyst<br>
    Organic its progeny<br>
    Voracious spectral offspring<br>
    So sweet in its hunger<br>
    Unbound this new vision<br>
    Optical regenesis<br>
    Threatening, so complete in beautiful deformity<br>
    These authoritive visions order my collective senses,<br>
    My questioning, doubtful, rigid self to kneel<br>
    A judas syndrome in effect<br>
    Former self the deceiver<br>
    Its denial the wretched kiss<br>
    That kept this in disguise<br>
    Cast off, the conceiling veil,<br>
    The rational cloak of doubt<br>
    Torn off, the restraints,<br>
    The blinded's shackles<br>
    Burned away, the agony, the fear, the grief<br>
    A new set of eyes cleansed by a new belief<br>
