How come I shiver, hurt and bleed,
If in dreams I cannot truly feel
Who would dare say, who would claim
This hallucination isn't real
Synaptical glitch looking glass
So enticing, real and free of lies
Prodigious, omnifarious
In nourishes, it feeds my starving eyes
Artificial the catalyst
Organic its progeny
Voracious spectral offspring
So sweet in its hunger
Unbound this new vision
Optical regenesis
Threatening, so complete in beautiful deformity
These authoritive visions order my collective senses,
My questioning, doubtful, rigid self to kneel
A judas syndrome in effect
Former self the deceiver
Its denial the wretched kiss
That kept this in disguise
Cast off, the conceiling veil,
The rational cloak of doubt
Torn off, the restraints,
The blinded's shackles
Burned away, the agony, the fear, the grief
A new set of eyes cleansed by a new belief
